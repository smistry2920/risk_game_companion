10-15-2013: (YAY, start date!)
**A little extra: 
	-This idea came to me yesterday when I decided to by
	risk legacy (which was, in and of itself, unusual since
	I dislike risk due to the length/pace of the game). 
	Since I was buying risk, why not build a companion/app 
	that helped make the game easier/quicker to play?
		-Goal 1: Handles dice rolling
		-Goal 2: Keeps track of player population/
			troops and tells how many given
			per recuitment step.
		-Goal 3: since it's for risk legacy, keep
			track of player wins and original
			color.
		-Goal 4: FINISH THE THING!!
		-Goal That Should Be Done: write proper
			documentation for future users of this
			companion/app
		-Goal In The Future: Android App
			(probably when I get a new phone ~Jan 2014).
**Completed***
	--NONE...(>_>)--
**ADDITIONS**
	--NONE...(>_>)--
***TO DO**:
	-Need to create base class for players
	-Need to create a way to keep track of population
		-probably writing to a text file
		-Include a way for growth calculation
	-Battle simulation (somewhat random dice rolls->
	probably tied to time)
	-Continent tracking
	-cards for troops??
	-player tracking (in text file too)
	-dice rolls!! (mentioned above)
	-------
